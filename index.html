                <p>Hello! I am currently working full time as well as enrolled in classes</p>
                <p>I am 28 years old, married to the love of my life and looking forward</p>
                <p>to being a dad.</p>
                <p>This is an essental step in my journey of providing a life for my family.</p>
                <p>In terms of things I enjoy, I would have to say that drawing is at the top,</p>
                <p>I also love biking, swimming, and reading fiction books.</p>
                <p>I am the first boy of six kids, and I love my family. I got really close to my</p>
                <p>siblings since we were all homeschooled, at least until I graduated, then a few of my</p>
                <p>sisters and one brother decided to finiish their highschool at an actual school</p>
                <p>I recently got a job at a construction company and have been using that as a means to pay</p>
                <p>for my schooling and to keep my wife and I in the city.</p>
                <p>Ultimately I would like to become a computer software developer, and help</p>
                <p>influence current and future trends in media</p>
